## Configuring the Mailer

To set up the mailer in your Rails application, follow these steps:

1. **Set up Action Mailer**:
   Ensure you have Action Mailer configured in your `config/environments/development.rb` (or `production.rb` for production settings). Hereâ€™s a basic configuration:

   ```ruby
   # config/environments/development.rb
   config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
   config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
        address: 'smtp.example.com',
    port: 587,
    domain: ENV['MAIL_HOST'],
    user_name: ENV['SENDMAIL_USERNAME'],
    password: ENV['SENDMAIL_PASSWORD'],
    authentication: 'plain',
    enable_starttls_auto: true
   }
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your SMTP server details.

2. **Set the Host for URL Generation**:
   In the same environment configuration file, set the default URL options:

   ```ruby
   config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
   ```

   Adjust the host and port as necessary for your environment.

## Running Sidekiq

Sidekiq is used for background job processing in your Rails application. To run Sidekiq, follow these steps:

1. **Install Sidekiq**:
   Ensure you have Sidekiq added to your Gemfile:

   ```ruby
   gem 'sidekiq'
   ```

   Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

2. **Configure Sidekiq**:
   Create a configuration file for Sidekiq if you haven't already. You can create `config/sidekiq.yml`:

   ```yaml
   :concurrency: 5
   :queues:
     - default
   ```

   Adjust the concurrency and queues as needed.

3. **Start Redis**:
   Sidekiq requires Redis to manage background jobs. Make sure you have Redis installed and running. You can start Redis with:

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

4. **Start Sidekiq**:
   In your terminal, navigate to your Rails application directory and run:

   ```bash
   bundle exec sidekiq
   ```

   This will start Sidekiq, and it will begin processing jobs in the background.

5. **Monitoring Sidekiq**:
   To monitor the Sidekiq dashboard, you can add a route in your `config/routes.rb`:

   ```ruby
   require 'sidekiq/web'
   mount Sidekiq::Web => '/sidekiq'
   ```

   You can access the dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/sidekiq` in your browser.
